 Project 1: Sales analysis

 This project is an analysis of a public dataset containing information about sales for one year. For better readability, it was done in Jupiter notebook using python and pandas. 

 After the cleaning of data, the dataset was expanded with additional columns and new useful calculations. Then an additional shorter dataset with monthly total revenue and percentage growth was created. 

At first, I practiced basic visualization with the mathplotlib library, then I created the more advanced Power BI report:

Project 2: Analysis of GDP by country 

 The second project is also done in Jupiter notebook using python and pandas.  I practiced working with three different datasets, with many missing values. 

The two datasets contain information about the GDP of countries for about 20 years, and the third one has information about their population. 

The data was cleaned and joined. Then the GDP per capita as well as the GDP growth rate was calculated. In the end I created a Power BI report with filled map and graphs where the user can choose the country and year, to get the corresponding data:
