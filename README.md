  # Project 1: Sales analysis
  * In this project is analysis of a public dataset containing information about sales for a period of one year.
  * For better readability it was done in Jupiter notebook using python and pandas. 
  * The used dataset includes the following columns:


  * After the cleaning of data, the dataset was expanded with additional columns and new usefull calculations:

  * Then an additional shorter dataset with monthly total revenue and percentage growth was created:


  * At first I have practiced in some basic visualisation with mathplotlit labruary.
  * Then I created the more advanced Power BI report:

 # Project 2: Analyse of GDP by country
  * The second project is also done in Jupiter notebook using python and pandas. 
  * The following project is practice for a bad scenario working with three different datasets, with many missing values.
  * The two datasets contain information about GDP of countries for about 20 years, and the third one has information about 
  their population. The data was cleaned and joined. Then the GDP per capita as well as the GDP growth rate was calculated.


  * Then I created a Power BI report with filled map and graphs where the user can choose the country and year, to 
   get the corresponding data:
