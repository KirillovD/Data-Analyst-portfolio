 #Project 1: Sales analysis

 *This project is an analysis of a public dataset containing information about sales for one year. For better readability, 
 it was done in Jupiter notebook using python and pandas. 

 *After the cleaning of data, the dataset was expanded with additional columns and new useful calculations. 
 Then an additional shorter dataset with monthly total revenue and percentage growth was created. 
 *At first, I practiced basic visualization with mathplotlib library, then I created the more advanced Power BI report.
