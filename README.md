<p>&nbsp;Project 1: Sales analysis </p>
<p>&nbsp;This project is an analysis of a public dataset containing information about sales for one year. For better readability, it was done in Jupiter notebook using python and pandas.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;After the cleaning of data, the dataset was expanded with additional columns and new useful calculations. Then an additional shorter dataset with monthly total revenue and percentage growth was created.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At first, I practiced basic visualization with mathplotlib library. &nbsp;Then I created the more advanced Power BI report: <iframe title="Report Section" width="1280" height="720" src="https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiZGUyMGNmOWItYWZkOC00ZTBkLTg3YTEtMDU4NzA4NmU0YzBiIiwidCI6IjlmODI3MWI0LWVkNzAtNDg4OC1iMmE4LWI5ZGIyNmQxMDE1MCJ9" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe> Project 2: Analyse of GDP by country&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;The second project is also done in Jupiter notebook using python and pandas. &nbsp;It is practice on working with three different datasets, with many missing values.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The two datasets contain information about GDP of countries for about 20 years, and the third one has information about their population.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The data was cleaned and joined. Then the GDP per capita as well as the GDP growth rate was calculated. Then I created a Power BI report with filled map and graphs where the user can choose the country and year, to get the corresponding data:&nbsp;<iframe title="Report Section" width="1300" height="1200" src="https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiZmZkNjdmYTEtMTMzNC00ZmJhLTg2NjMtMmExNWUxNzM5MzA3IiwidCI6IjlmODI3MWI0LWVkNzAtNDg4OC1iMmE4LWI5ZGIyNmQxMDE1MCJ9" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe> </p>
